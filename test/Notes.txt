-gdb will not read and lines if the intrsuctions are in caps
-gdb will skip over a entire labels body if there is a commant not inline with an instuction
	ie, above it. will 
	-Put all comments inline (mov ax, bx ; some bullshite)
	-or else at the begining to a label


turns out you cannot pass the direct value to the
std_out sys call need to pass via reference.... 
this took an hour to figure out :(


instruction pointer only gets set when you perform a call
if you do just a jmp and try to ret it will core dump!
